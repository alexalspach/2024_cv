	<h2>My name is Alex</h2>
</div>

<div class="well">

<p>
I am a research engineer and leader with a passion for developing thoughtfully and creatively considered robotic systems with great interest in soft robotics and human-robot interaction. I have international experience working and researching on diverse teams in both academia and industry.
</p>

<p>
I hold Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from Drexel University and have been working and researching in robotics since the outset of my university career.
</p>

<p>
While in school, I spent seven months in South Korea’s Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) studying the manufacture and construction of their humanoid robot, HUBO. After graduating, I spent two more years in Korea as an engineer at SimLab in Seoul where I developed and marketed hardware and software tools for robotics research. While there, I also got the chance to work with a professional production company to develop artists' software tools for animating complex, constrained and synchronized robot motions for film and other displays. After that, I developed soft <i>huggable</i> robots and various other creative and entertaining robotic systems at Disney Research in Pittsburgh.
</p>

<p>
Now a manager and technical lead at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) in Cambridge, MA, I run a small team called the "Punyo Team" exploring whole-body tactile sensing, learning, and control of soft robotic systems for human-robot interaction and dexterous, contact-rich whole-body manipulation [<a href="https://youtu.be/FY-MD4gteeE" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">video</a>].
</p>

<p>
Please take a look through my CV, full of <a href="http://www.alexalspach.com/cv/#projects" class="flip-colors">projects from work and play</a>, and feel free to email me with any questions and comments!
